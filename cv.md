### **Information about myself**

My goal is to become a demanded Front-end development specialist. Now I devote all my free time to learning web development. A year ago I graduated from the university with a degree in power engineering and now I decided to study a new one again. I really enjoy learning, especially when the results are visible immediately.


In the future, I would like to get a job related to this specialty and develop as a developer.
